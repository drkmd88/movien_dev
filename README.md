### Project Description
This is a group project of UIUC CS411: Database Systems. It presents a web application of IMDB movie and director data. Users can
choose directors based on their flavors and view U.S movie market through interactive visualization.

We started with 12GB data, parsed and stored into Relational Database.

Then we built a python-based web framework with the help of Django and Flask. Index is used to accelerate search. Visualization
is done at the help of javascript D3 library and Python Bokeh library.

More detailed functions and explanation about website development can be found in our report. 
The website can be viewed on Youtube. Here is the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F3-nDkWjog
